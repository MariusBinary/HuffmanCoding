# Huffman Coding
Huffman Coding is a tool allows you to encode text using huffman encoding. <br /> <br />
You can try the app directly on our website: [Live demo](https://www.mariusbinary.altervista.org/huffman_coding.php).

## Write a text or upload a file to be encoded.

## Features:
- **Input**: You can write the text to be encoded directly in the dedicated section on the browser or you can choose a file from your pc to convert it directly.
- **Diagram**: The result of the encoding is provided in the form of a tree diagram with which you can interact by hovering the cursor over the character to see the path.
- **Table**: All the encoded characters can be viewed through a table indicating their various characteristics.
- **Comparison**: The program also makes a comparison between Huffman and ASCII encoding to see which is more efficient.
